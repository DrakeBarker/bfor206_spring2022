# BFOR 206 Lab
## Class 10-2: Using Modules to store functions


# Task Description

In this lab, we will move the find_url function and its tests
to a separate module and then import and use the function.





# Test Cases

## Case 1
Show that you can import the module and run the find_urls()
function.
```python
import text_processing
urls = aiml_data['post'].apply(text_processing.find_urls)
```

# Submission instructions

**Scripts that produce unhandled errors will not be accepted!**

Run assertions to show that the function passes the tests
shown above.

When you are finished, submit two screenshots on Blackboard:
1.  A screenshot showing that you can run the commands
    shown in Case 1
